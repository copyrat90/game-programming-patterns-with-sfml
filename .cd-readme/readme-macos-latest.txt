========== NOTICE ==========

This is a binary release for the Mac OS;
If you're running other OS, you need to download the other version from the link above.

Unfortunately, it is not tested, because I don't own a Mac PC.


========== Running ==========

See ./Patterns/{xx-Pattern}/{yy-Example}/RelWithDebInfo/{xx_Pattern_yy_Example}
That is the executable.

You need to change your working directory to the ../RelWithDebInfo
If you don't, the program won't load the assets properly, and will terminate immediately.


========== Licenses ==========

./LICENSE file is the license of the IGPP.
./licenses/ folder contains third-party licenses for the shared libraries.
./Patterns/{xx-Pattern}/{yy-Example}/assets folder contains the license of the asset, with the asset itself.
