# Contributing
First of all, thank you so much for considering contributing to this project!

## Branching model
This project uses [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

The `main` branch is an active dev branch, so it is not production-ready.\
When you want to work on something,
create a branch directly from `main`, work on it, and send a PR to `main` branch.

## Do
1. If you want to make changes other than fixing bugs, **create an issue and discuss first.**
    * Otherwise, It is possible that the changes are not accepted, and your time spent on those changes goes to waste.
2. Follow the same **code format** specified on `/.clang-format` and `/.editorconfig`
    * Easiest way to format your code: Add auto-formatting plugins to your editor
3. **Rebase to latest `main` branch before submitting PR**
    * To minimize merge conflicts with latest `main`
